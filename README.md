My Hackpad: Nelson's Gaming Keys is designed specifically for games that tend to use WASD movement and two additional keys like in Marvel Rivals where the game tends to be based on Q and LSHIFT. 

The pad has all of the keys simplified to ease your gaming experience, to not have slip ups when gaming in an intense environment where a misclick leads to failure. 

As of now, the design for best mobility is still a work in progress but the current design is a sight-to-behold.
