My Hackpad: Nelson's Gaming Keys is designed specifically for games that tend to use WASD movement and two additional keys like in Marvel Rivals where the game tends to be based on Q and LSHIFT. 

The pad has all of the keys simplified to ease your gaming experience, to not have slip ups when gaming in an intense environment where a misclick leads to failure. 

As of now, the design for best mobility is still a work in progress but the current design is a sight-to-behold. 

I have added the components to see the fit of the components to the overall pad. I have borrowed other's CAD for the switches and seeed xiao rp2040. https://github.com/ConstantinoSchillebeeckx/cherry-mx-switch/blob/master/switch.step for the switch and https://www.printables.com/model/1344046-3d-model-for-seeed-studio-xiao-rp2040/files for the seeed.
